# Phapi Configuration
This is an example (and the recommendend) way to configure the Phapi Framework. This package includes the default configuration as well as configuration of extra packages (these are disabled by default). This makes it more easy to see how and in what order for example middleware should be added to the pipeline.

See the [documentation](http://phapi.github.io) for more information.
